Requirements for Viz Clone App:
The app runs the following steps:
1. The user inputs credentials (username and password) for the source and destination orgs
2. The user clicks test connection button to confirm credentials are valid
3. The user clicks get dataspaces button
4. The user selects the dataspace from a list of dataspaces
5. The user clicks get all vizzes for selected dataspace button
6. The app gets all vizzes from the source org and displays them in a list
7. The user selects one or more vizzes from the list
8. The app gets all of the data assets associated with the selected vizzes
9. The user clicks the clone button
10. The app clones all of the data assets (Datasource, DataStream, DLO, DMO, SemanticModel) associated with the selected vizzes
11. The app clones the vizzes
12. The app displays notification that the clone is complete


Blockers:
1. The ability to create data streams of type HerokuPostgres is not working. 
2. The ability to upload csv to data cloud is not working, however the ability to creat a data stream of type CSV is working. 

Next Steps:
1. The ability to get/create a viz collection
2. Ask John why simple-salesforce is not working for the get viz and dashboard calls


I'm building a migration tool. It take inputs for source and destination.
I need to parse and transform the response from getDashboard in the source org to create the payload in postDashboard to create the dashboard in destination org

Example source:
org = 'storm-dc631f52cc1aeb.my.salesforce.com'
username = 'jcraycraft.6890ccbb70@salesforce.com'
password = 'orgfarm1234'
data_space = 'default'
dashboard_api_name = '1AKHo000000GmaEOAS'

Example destination:
org = 'storm-dc631f52cc1aeb.my.salesforce.com'
username = 'jcraycraft.6890ccbb70@salesforce.com'
password = 'orgfarm1234'
data_space = 'default'
dashboard_label = 'New dashboard name'


Payload transformation for getDash (get) --> postDash (create):
1. For any of the objects under widgets, delete label key under the source object ([widgets][visualization_#][source][label] where # can be number starting at 1
2. Delete permissions, createdBy, createdDate, customViews, url and id keys at root
3. Change label value to destination_dashboard_label 
4. Delete label for pages array


I'm building a migration tool. It take inputs for source and destination.
I need to parse and transform the response from getVisualization in the source org to create the payload in postVisualization to create the visualization in destination org

Example source:
org = 'storm-dc631f52cc1aeb.my.salesforce.com'
username = 'jcraycraft.6890ccbb70@salesforce.com'
password = 'orgfarm1234'
data_space = 'default'
visualization_api_name = '1AKHo000000GmaEOAS'

Example destination:
org = 'storm-dc631f52cc1aeb.my.salesforce.com'
username = 'jcraycraft.6890ccbb70@salesforce.com'
password = 'orgfarm1234'
data_space = 'default'
visualization_label = 'New visualization name june 23'


Payload transformation for getDash (get) --> postDash (create):
1. Delete createdBy, createdDate, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedDate, permissions at root
2. Delete [view][id] and [view][isOriginal] keys
3. Delete [fields][F#][id] for all F#
4. Delete [workspace][url]








Detailed Steps:
1. Get all Viz
2. User selects Viz (allow user to select multiple Viz)
3. Get semantic model associated with the Viz
4. Get the semantic data object collection for the semantic model (DMO; e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse__dlm)
5. Get the semantic data object for each DMO in the collection
6. Get all data streams
7. Filter the data stream that match the semantic data object (DLO)
8. 


Assumptions:
1. The Viz response includes the semantic model name
2. The semantic model data object collection response includes the data object name (DMO)
3. The getDataStreams response includes the DLO info (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)



Facts:
The semantic data object collection (DMO) response include DLO info (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse)
The semantic model response include DMO
The data streams response include DLO info (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)
The DLO should include the data stream name
The DMO should include both the DLO and data stream name
The semantic model is associated with a semantic data object collection (DMO)
The DMO is associated with a DLO (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368) and a data stream (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)
The DLO is associated with a data stream (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)
The data stream is associated with a DLO (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368) and includes data source information
