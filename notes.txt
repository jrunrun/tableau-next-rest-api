Requirements for Viz Clone App:
The app runs the following steps:
1. The user inputs credentials for the source and destination orgs
2. The user clicks test connection button to confirm credentials are valid
3. The user clicks get dataspaces button
4. The user selects the dataspace from a list of dataspaces
5. The user clicks get all vizzes for selected dataspace button
6. The app gets all vizzes from the source org and displays them in a list
7. The user selects one or more vizzes from the list
8. The app gets all of the data assets associated with the selected vizzes
9. The user clicks the clone button
10. The app clones all of the data assets (Datasource, DataStream, DLO, DMO, SemanticModel) associated with the selected vizzes
11. The app clones the vizzes
12. The app displays notification that the clone is complete







Detailed Steps:
1. Get all Viz
2. User selects Viz (allow user to select multiple Viz)
3. Get semantic model associated with the Viz
4. Get the semantic data object collection for the semantic model (DMO; e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse__dlm)
5. Get the semantic data object for each DMO in the collection
6. Get all data streams
7. Filter the data stream that match the semantic data object (DLO)
8. 


Assumptions:
1. The Viz response includes the semantic model name
2. The semantic model data object collection response includes the data object name (DMO)
3. The getDataStreams response includes the DLO info (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)



Facts:
The semantic data object collection (DMO) response include DLO info (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse)
The semantic model response include DMO
The data streams response include DLO info (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)
The DLO should include the data stream name
The DMO should include both the DLO and data stream name
The semantic model is associated with a semantic data object collection (DMO)
The DMO is associated with a DLO (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368) and a data stream (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)
The DLO is associated with a data stream (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368)
The data stream is associated with a DLO (e.g. Retail_NTO_Dataverse_17338_1745859943368) and includes data source information
